# DQN Agent

The first solution to solving the CartPole problem was a dqn (deep q network) agent. The dqn agent follows the basic Q-Learning principle but uses a neural network to predict the q-values instead of a q-function or q-table (see .... for further details).

My implementation of this agent uses a batch training approach where instead of single samples randomly drawn batches of stored data is used to train the q network.
